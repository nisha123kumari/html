            yes, I am coauther of Introsuction to Algorithems, along with <u><b>charles Leiserson,Ron Rivest, and cliff stein.</b></u>

            here are answers to a few ftequently asked questions about introduction to Algorithems:
            <br>
            will there be a fourth edition?If so, when will it be available?
            <br>
            <i>How do I report errors?</i>
            First,please visit the <a href="nisha.html"target="blank">nisha.html</a> to verify that the error has not been reported already.
            <br>
            <i>Do you correct errors?</i>
            <br>
            yes Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by the time.

          <p>  <i>how can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode in the book?</i>
            <br> I created two packages for <h5>LaTeX2e</h5>. The clrscode package gives you pseudocode in the style of the second edition, and the clrscode3e package gives you pseudocode in the style of the third edition. You can download either package and its documentation by clicking here. The clrscode package is also on the <u> CTAN website</u>.
          <p> <i>Can you send me a free copy of the book? Can you send me an electronic copy of the book? Can you help me with this algorithms problem I have?</i>
          <br>
            No, no, and sorry, but no. You can purchase an electronic copy of the book, however: Amazon.com now sells a version of Introduction to Algorithms for Kindle.
             <i> 
             I see that there are two versions of the second edition, one published by the MIT Press and one published by McGraw-Hill. How do the two versions differ?</i></p>
             <br></p>
            <br>
          
            <p> Other than minor differences in the covers, the book content in the two versions is identical. McGraw-Hill also includes a CD (see the next question).
           <i> Are the algorithms in the book implemented in a real programming language, rather than just pseudocode?</i>
            In the second edition,&nbsp; McGraw-Hill included with the book a CD containing Java implementations of all the algorithms in Parts I-VI. The CD also has Javadoc-generated web pages that document all the classes. We did not update the Java implementations for the third edition.
            <br>  For the fourth edition,&nbsp; we will make available on the MIT Press website implementations in Python by Linda Xiao and me.

            <br>you can also read about me on <u>Wikipedia</u> (Note: I did not create this entry, nor have I edited it.) I had been listed among "Noted residents, past and present" in the Wikipedia page on Oceanside, NY, but someone removed me from the Oceanside page with the notation "Removed notable people who barely lived there or people who are not notable." Since I lived in Oceanside for the first 18 years of my life, I can only conclude that I am not notable.

            My wife, Nicole, and I took a Barbecue tour of the South in August 1998.
            <br>
            
            In July 2010, I rollerbladed the Trail of the Coeur D'Alenes, a 71.4-mile-long paved rail trail in the Idaho panhandle. Accompanied by my friend, Paul Daro, who also bladed, and Nicole, who biked, we went 42 miles the first day and the balance the second day. Here is a photo of the three of us at the start of the first day, at the western trailhead in Plummer, Idaho, (on the Coeur D'Alene reservation) and here is a photo of Paul and me at the start of the second day, at the eastern trailhead in Mullan, Idaho. We met this fellow on the trail during the first day. This page has some rough videos that Paul took.

            I was the Ice Man for the Maryland State Barbecue Championship in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Here's a photo from the 2005 contest of me with a quad-runner full of 40-pound bags of ice. The photo was taken by the Dizzy Pigs, the 2005 and 2006 Grand Champions. Even with the megaphone, I was pretty hoarse by the end of the second day. The Dizzy Pigs, and all the other contestants, can explain why.
            
            I was Kansas City Barbeque Society Certified Barbeque Judge number 62145. (I have purposely let my KCBS membership lapse.) My first contest as a certified judge was the 2011 Maryland State Championship in Bel Air. Here is a photo of me just starting to judge the first item, chicken. And here is a photo after judging five entries each of chicken, pork ribs, pork, and beef brisket. (Photos courtesy of Craig Ward, a.k.a. "Mr. Time To Go," a.k.a. "Large And In Charge," the contest organizer.)

            In September 1997, Nicole and I finished hiking all 48 of the 4000-foot peaks in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
